##Embedded Project Document

*Project has 2 lifecycle.*

**1.Basic functionality life cycle (BFLC):**
  - Each Task in the project has a simple embedded code that shows the basic application example. For example: Bluetooth connection code, shows the initialization and simple data transfer.
  - Each Task with the hardware component has a connection diagram that shows the connection of commponents with the development board. For Example: Bluetooth module diagram and connection pin with initialization.

**2. TODO life cycle:**
  - Most of the Basic Functionality tasks are should build up to more complex and usefull tasks. For Example: Stepper motor drive should work as explained in project specifications.
  - Hardware connections will not much change but even if so, should be new diagram for it.
